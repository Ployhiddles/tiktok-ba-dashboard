# TikTok Behavioral Analytics Dashboard

An interactive data analytics dashboard that transforms raw TikTok personal data exports into
actionable behavioral insights. The application allows users to upload their TikTok data (ZIP export)
and explore engagement patterns, activity trends, and usage behavior over time.

## 📌 Problem Statement
TikTok provides users with downloadable personal data, but the raw export is difficult to interpret.
Files are large, semi-structured, and not designed for analysis. This project bridges that gap by
converting raw TikTok data into a clear, visual analytics experience.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Activity and engagement trends over time
- Frequency of user interactions (e.g., comments, activity logs)
- Behavioral patterns in content consumption
- Identification of peak usage periods
